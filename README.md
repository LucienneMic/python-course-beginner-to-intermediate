## Overview
This repository contains a **14-week Python programming course**, designed to take learners from beginner concepts to unit testing. Each week includes exercises, solutions, and learning objectives. The course culminates in a **Capstone Project** where students apply all concepts learned.

**Skills Covered:**
- Python fundamentals: variables, control flow, functions
- Data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- File I/O, modules, exception handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Working with external data (JSON, CSV, APIs)
- Unit testing using `unittest`
- Project design and organization

## Capstone Project: Student Grade Tracker
The final project allows learners to **apply all Python concepts** in a practical scenario.

**Features:**
- Add, edit, delete students and grades
- Calculate averages and top performers
- Save data to CSV or JSON
- Unit tests for key functions

**Folder Structure:**
- `src/` → Python source code  
- `tests/` → Unit tests using `unittest`  
- `data/` → Sample CSV/JSON files
